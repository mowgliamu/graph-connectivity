There are a few possible reasons why the component (union-find) approach might be slower than the traditional DFS approach for your specific case:

    - The graph is not highly connected. If the graph is not highly connected, then the union-find data structure will need to perform more unions and finds, which - can be slower than the DFS traversal.
    - The graph is large. The union-find data structure needs to maintain a set for each node in the graph, which can be a lot of memory overhead for large graphs.
    - The implementation of the union-find data structure is inefficient. There are different ways to implement the union-find data structure, and some implementations are more efficient than others.

It is also possible that the traditional DFS approach is simply more efficient for your specific graph. This could be due to the way the graph is structured or the way the DFS algorithm is implemented.

To determine why the component (union-find) approach is slower for your specific case, you can try the following:

    - Measure the time complexity of both approaches. This will give you a better understanding of how much slower the union-find approach is.
    - Profile the code of both approaches. This will help you identify which parts of the code are taking the most time.
    - Try a different implementation of the union-find data structure. There are different ways to implement the union-find data structure, and some implementations are more efficient than others.

If you are still unable to determine why the union-find approach is slower for your specific case, you can post your question on a programming forum or mailing list. There are many experienced programmers who can help you troubleshoot your problem.
